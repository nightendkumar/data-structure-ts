Big-O notation
It gives us upper bound of the running time according to the input size in the worst case scenario.
We usually denote input size with n.

Constant: O(1)
Linear: O(n)
Logarthimic: O(logn)
Linearithmic: O(nlogn)
Quadratic: O(n^2)
Exponential: O(a^n)
Factorial: O(n!)

Bicause Big-O only cares about large input sizes, we drop constants and ignore smaller terms.


1) Static vs Dynamic arrays
2) Linked list
   It is a linear data structure where the elements are not stores in 
   contiguous memory locations.
   The elements in linked list are linked using pointers.
